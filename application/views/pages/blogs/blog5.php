                                <p class="news-details__text-1">Thermoplastics are preferred as they are easy to shape and mold when heated. Most of the thermoplastics known to man are used in designing everyday products. There are a few that are expensive and are used to replace metal objects of any design. These are suited for various applications because of their lightweight and high strength. </p>
                                <p class="news-details__text-2">Poly-paper is a biodegradable and recyclable material that can be processed as a conventional thermoplastic polymer, but recyclable into paper and cardboard recycling chain. The selected matrix for the composite formulation is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a polymer-based material with water soluble properties and forming non-toxic composites.</p>
                                <p class="news-details__text-3">A final experimental session aimed at verifying the recyclability of Poly-paper in the cellulosic recycling channel. Mechanical tensile test results exhibited a good stress-strain behaviour as well as a close correlation between cellulose fibres content and tensile proprieties.</p>
                                <p class="news-details__text-4">Pounds of Plastics is a reputed firm that specializes in engineering thermoplastics for various applications. The major focus of the company is on producing both reinforced and unreinforced grades of nylon. The company also specializes in offering thermoplastics that belong to other resin families.</p>
